-- apisano 2018-02-21:
-- - added proper removal of cr_child_rels when item is deleted.
-- - streamlined idioms
-- - added missing on delete cascade
-- - removed dead acs_objects formerly linked to deleted cr_child_rels

-- Cleanup

-- delete dead tuples coming from sins of the past (mostly erased portraits)
select acs_object__delete(object_id) from acs_objects o
 where object_type = 'cr_item_child_rel' and
   not exists (select 1 from cr_child_rels where rel_id = o.object_id);


-- Data model upgrade

alter table images
  drop constraint images_image_id_fk,
